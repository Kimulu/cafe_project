# cafe_project

This project uses Flask, bootstrap5 and html. Its main purpose is to find Cafes near you that
you can work remotely. Also it keeps records of cafes you add , and can also let a user delete
a cafe from the database.
The project utilizes the Google API to find cafes and restaurants near you when you click the
find cafe button.
Feel free to fork it and use your own API key from google to give it a spin.
